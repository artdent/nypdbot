Overview
========

Nypdbot is a package for writing Python scripts to control Pure Data.

It has three components:

- pdctl: A patching library that allows construction of Pure Data object graphs
- mta: A generator-based event sequencer
- driver.pd: A tiny Pure Data patch to listen on a socket

The public interface is made available in the "nypdbot" module.

Typical usage is to open the driver.pd patch in Pure Data and then run your
program. See examples/swarm.py as an example.

Nypdbot is tested against python 2.7; it currently works on python 3 without
modification, but this is not guaranteed.

Implementation
==============

Nypdbot controls Pure Data via the "dynamic patching" technique:
sending messages to the "pd" selector to control Pure Data, and sending
messages to the "pd-foo" selector to manipulate canvas foo.

Purity uses twisted, which is way more than I want to deal with for a
hobby project :-).

Purity, Pyata, and PyPd try to manage the Pure Data process themselves, whereas
Nypdbot makes no such attempts. I typically just leave Pure Data running
and have my scripts start by clearing the operative patch.

PyPd provides control over the Pd process and bidirectional communication with
pd, but no patching functions. You probably could use it together with nypdbot.

Topd is most similar to this library; I probably would have hacked on it
instead had I found it before starting.

Use whichever library makes you happy, productive, and loud.

TODO
====

- More tests
- Deleting connections and objects
- Enumerating and manipulating active shards
- Integration with code.interact for live manipulation of pd
- Examples that demonstrate adding shards to mta during the event loop
- Examples that demonstrate manipulating the pd object graph during the
  event loop
