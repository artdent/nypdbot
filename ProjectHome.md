Nypdbot is a Python package for writing Python scripts to control [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/).

It has three components:
  * A patching library that allows construction of Pure Data object graphs
  * A generator-based event sequencer
  * A tiny Pure Data patch to listen on a socket

See the [README](http://code.google.com/p/nypdbot/source/browse/README) for more info.

The name stands for New York Pure Data Bot.
